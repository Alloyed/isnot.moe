# isnot.moe

Tells you when things aren't moe.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 1.7.0 or above installed on your dev
machine. On your webhost you will need a copy of the JRE at v6 or above.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

	lein ring server

This will likely not be all that interesting, because localhost by
default has no subdomains. You can add some yourself in your /etc/hosts
file for testing:

	127.0.0.1 anon._isnot.moe

If you want to install it on a real website, use a jar built by:

	lein ring uberjar
